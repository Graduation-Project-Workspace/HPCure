## üöÄ Features

- **MRI Tumor Segmentation**
  - Uses TensorFlow Lite models and fuzzy connectedness algorithms.
  
- **Tumor Volume Estimation**
  - Automatically calculates volume based on segmented regions.

- **Dual Computation Modes**
  - **Parallel Mode:** Tasks like seed prediction, ROI detection, and segmentation run simultaneously for faster processing on multi-core devices.
  - **Serial Mode:** Tasks are executed one by one ‚Äî ideal for low-resource environments or deterministic processing.

---

## üß† Machine Learning Models

- **ROI Detection** and **Seed Prediction** are powered by custom-trained models using **YOLOv8**.
- These models were trained on labeled breast MRI datasets.
- The trained models were then exported to **TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)** format for seamless integration into the Android app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

### 1. Input
- Upload or select MRI DICOM files or binary image slices through the app interface.

### 2. Processing
- **YOLOv8-derived TFLite models** are used for seed and ROI prediction.
- **Fuzzy Connectedness** is applied to perform image segmentation.
- User selects between **parallel** and **serial** modes.

### 3. Output
- Results are accessible through the app‚Äôs interface. The output files are stored in the app‚Äôs internal storage and are not directly accessible via the device‚Äôs file manager.
